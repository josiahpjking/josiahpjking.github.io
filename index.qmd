I am currently a lecturer in quantitative methods in psychology at the [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/){target="_blank"}. I coordinate the teaching of undergraduate and postgraduate courses in statistics & quantitative methods using R and provide support to students and staff.  

I have previously worked for the Scottish Centre for Administrative Data Research (SCADR), and for the Scottish Government. I completed my PhD in Psychology at the University of Edinburgh, studying nonverbal behaviour in relation to deception and cognitive load. 

I am open to collaborations and PhD (co-)supervision on anything methods-y. You can contact me at josiah dot king @ed.ac.uk
