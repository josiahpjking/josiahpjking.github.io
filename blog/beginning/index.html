<p>but <em>how loud you shout about what you think</em>.</p>

<p>So much of the content found online about statistics seems to exude confidence and knowledge about complex methodologies. It almost seems like there is one group of people who are often over-confident, and (perhaps unintentionally) appear quite condescending in their explanations (see e.g., every stackoverflow answer ever), and another group who are perpetually terrified that they&rsquo;re getting it wrong[^0
].</p>

<p>Both of these groups are basically trying to avoid one thing - looking stupid.
I am not sure I have that level of confidence in anything, let alone something like statistics which is often pretty complicated. In fact, even the <em>basic</em> bits of statistics can be really difficult.</p>

<h2 id="understanding-contrast-matrices-without-matrix-algebra">understanding contrast matrices without matrix algebra</h2>

<p>in one of our stats courses, we teach about contrast matrices for linear models without teaching any matrix algebra.<br />
naturally, people want to find patterns in the contrast matrix to see what groups are being compared. e.g., look for the row of all 0s, and the column is the group==1, compared to that row (dummy coding).</p>

<p>but this doesn&rsquo;t work for something such as treatment coding.  students are told that it is the greoup==1 compared to the grand mean. but it&rsquo;s hard to explain how this comes about..
when I first tutored on this course, I found it really difficult to explain.
in fact, it still is.</p>

<p>I had</p>

<p>I noticed this in other tutors - myself and another tutor realised that we had been incorrectly interpreting something on one of the courses. when we asked other tutors, they gave the same incorrect interpretation. When we explained how this was incorrect, and that we needed help working out how to correctly work it out, we tended to get one of two responses. Either they understood that it was incorrect, and helped trying to think about it. or, they dismissed their incorrect answer, and gave an explanation of &ldquo;of, that&rsquo;s jut because of those numbers there [walks away]&ldquo;. I&rsquo;m inclined to think this first group of people will make better statisticians, despite perhaps being less naturally adept.</p>
