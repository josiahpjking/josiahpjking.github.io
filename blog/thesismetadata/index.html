<p>intro
recently submitted phd
i wish i had set this up earlier (i.e., when I started), but in the middle of my second year (by which point i&rsquo;d written some stuff already), i thought it would be fun to track my word count.
- honestly, it was more just a procrastination aid one morning</p>

<p>having submitted recently, i figured that the numbers will likely not change any more, so here we are.
obviously, there&rsquo;s a big issue of quality &gt; quantity, so i would encourage current phd students not to get too fixated on the wordcount.
(that said, i&rsquo;m not sure if i had either quality or quantity! provided you learnt something, and you had (some) fun, then that should count as a success)</p>

<p>anyhow, here&rsquo;s the progress of my work, and below i will talk through the process</p>

<p>plot&ndash;
the first thing which strikes me is - writing is quite slow.
there are big gaps where i was doing an internship (a smaller one for christmas), but other than that it&rsquo;s fairly consistent.
you can see big increase - the motivation of being offered a job and the time pressure suddenly being real.</p>

<p>let&rsquo;s look at the different chapters.
-plot
i had imagined that there would be much more definite periods devoted to different chapters, but in reality the process was quite skittish for me - i often switched between different chapters - in fact, i edited multiple chapters in most weeks/days rather than focusing on only one
-table/plot
nr chapters edited in week/day.</p>

<p>productivity over the week.
this is possibly inaccurate as words were counted on reboot. If I came in everyday, then this would simply mean the difference in word count could be attributable to the day prior. If i missed a day, it becomes hard to ascertain which day the words were actually written on
-plot</p>

<p>how to do it
running linux, writing in latex.
crontab -e
@reboot /home/josiah/&hellip;&hellip;/countingwords.sh</p>

<p>i set it going on startup. i like to turn off my machine every evening, but in hindsight this setup makes it difficult to look at productivity by day of the week in situations where i miss a day.
(if I had to leave it on for updates/running models, I would just come in the following morning and run the shell script directly if i remembered).</p>

<p>the bash script itself is pretty simple.
it just writes the date, and then the texcount (brief output) for any .tex files in the two directories I had content in</p>

<p>#!/bin/bash
date +&lsquo;%Y-%m-%d&rsquo; &gt;&gt; ~/Desktop/&hellip;/wordcount.txt
texcount -brief ~/Desktop/&hellip;/chapters/<em>.tex ~/Desktop/&hellip;/preface/</em>.tex &gt;&gt; ~/Desktop/&hellip;/wordcount.txt</p>

<p>the output is pretty readable (as you&rsquo;d expect)</p>

<p>next step is tidying this into something we can work with.</p>

<p>R script.</p>

<p>now that it&rsquo;s in long format, plotting is nice and easy.</p>

<p>also possible to automate this via crontab, so that your plots update as you write, without any need for you to do anything at all!
