		<div class="post-content"><p>Life in the past six months

for me<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:0"><a href="#fn:0">1</a></sup> has seen a shift into the world of &lsquo;ADR&rsquo;.<br />
For those who don&rsquo;t know, ADR stands for &ldquo;administrative data research&rdquo;, and the tagline is about analysing public sector data for the public good.<br />
This all sounds great! <del>Ready, available</del> data about real-world institutions and the people who come in to contact with them! We&rsquo;re going to learn so much!!</p>

<p>As it turns out, I should have paid more attention to this acronym, the key word being <em>administrative</em>.<br />
So far the most of my work has involve quite a lot of meetings, filling in a reasonable number of complicated forms (each one quite a lot of times).</p>

<p style="font-size:0.8em">``The complexity of the permissions process (time, number of organisations, potential hurdles, etc.) creates a large barrier to entry for researchers. The current landscape necessitates a guide to identify the required points of application, to lay-out the process for each organisation, and to ensure applications are made in the most efficient order. Whereas research support officers in organisations such as the ADRC-S can (and do) help in this regard, this relies overly on the expert knowledge of specific individuals and on the existence (and capacity) of these support organisations. The future of administrative research, then, is fragile: without clear and consistent processes, and without help to guide them between processes, new researchers would doubtless be lost.''</p>
