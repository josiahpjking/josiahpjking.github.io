		<h1><a href="../../post/thesis-metadata/">thesis_metadata</a> (Draft)</h1>

		<div class="post-content"><p>intro recently submitted phd i wish i had set this up earlier (i.e., when I started), but in the middle of my second year (by which point i’d written some stuff already), i thought it would be fun to track my word count. - honestly, it was more just a procrastination aid one morning</p>
<p>having submitted recently, i figured that the numbers will likely not change any more, so here we are. obviously, there’s a big issue of quality &gt; quantity, so i would encourage current phd students not to get too fixated on the wordcount. (that said, i’m not sure if i had either quality or quantity! provided you learnt something, and you had (some) fun, then that should count as a success)</p>
<p>anyhow, here’s the progress of my work, and below i will talk through the process</p>
<p>plot– the first thing which strikes me is - writing is quite slow. there are big gaps where i was doing an internship (a smaller one for christmas), but other than that it’s fairly consistent. you can see big increase - the motivation of being offered a job and the time pressure suddenly being real.</p>
<p>let’s look at the different chapters. -plot i had imagined that there would be much more definite periods devoted to different chapters, but in reality the process was quite skittish for me - i often switched between different chapters - in fact, i edited multiple chapters in most weeks/days rather than focusing on only one -table/plot nr chapters edited in week/day.</p>
<p>productivity over the week. this is possibly inaccurate as words were counted on reboot. If I came in everyday, then this would simply mean the difference in word count could be attributable to the day prior. If i missed a day, it becomes hard to ascertain which day the words were actually written on -plot</p>
<p>how to do it running linux, writing in latex. crontab -e <span class="citation">@reboot</span> /home/josiah/……/countingwords.sh</p>
<p>i set it going on startup. i like to turn off my machine every evening, but in hindsight this setup makes it difficult to look at productivity by day of the week in situations where i miss a day. (if I had to leave it on for updates/running models, I would just come in the following morning and run the shell script directly if i remembered).</p>
<p>the bash script itself is pretty simple. it just writes the date, and then the texcount (brief output) for any .tex files in the two directories I had content in</p>
<div id="binbash" class="section level1">
<h1>!/bin/bash</h1>
<p>date +‘%Y-%m-%d’ &gt;&gt; ~/Desktop/…/wordcount.txt texcount -brief ~/Desktop/…/chapters/<em>.tex ~/Desktop/…/preface/</em>.tex &gt;&gt; ~/Desktop/…/wordcount.txt</p>
<p>the output is pretty readable (as you’d expect)</p>
<p>next step is tidying this into something we can work with.</p>
<p>R script.</p>
<p>now that it’s in long format, plotting is nice and easy.</p>
<p>also possible to automate this via crontab, so that your plots update as you write, without any need for you to do anything at all! <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38778732/schedule-a-rscript-crontab-everyminute" class="uri">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38778732/schedule-a-rscript-crontab-everyminute</a></p>
