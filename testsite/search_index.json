This year-long course is designed to work gently through conceptual content that form the basis of understanding and working with data to perform statistical testing. It will provide you with the foundations in working with data and probability theory, and build to learning about how we make inferences about our hypotheses in psychology. Concepts are demonstrated in R throughout, taking you from basic calculations to the foundations of data management, plotting and use of simple statistical tests. The overall aim of the course is to provide you with all the necessary skills to feel confident in the basics of statistics, R and data, before we move on to discuss a broader array of statistical methods in year 2.

Then click Create Project: Option B: Rstudio Cloud (for chromebook users) Register for Rstudio Cloud (https://rstudio.cloud/). Log in to Rstudio Cloud Create a new project Rename the project Intro to Rstudio Okay, now you should have a project open, and you should see something which looks more or less like the below, where there are several little windows. TODO ss We’re going to explore what each of these little windows offer by just diving in and starting to do things. R as a calculator Starting in the top left, you’ll notice the little blue arrow. This is where we R code gets executed. Type 2+2, and hit enter ↵ It’s a calculator! Let’s work through some of the basic operations (adding, subtracting etc). Try these commands yourself: 2+5 10-4 2*5 10-(2*5) (10-2)*5 10/2 Now let’s take a sidestep. As well as performing calculations, we can ask R things, such as “Is 3 less than 5?”: 3&lt;5 [1] TRUE Try the following: 3&gt;5 - “is 3 greater than 5?” 3&lt;=5 - “is 3 less than OR equal to 5?” 3&gt;=3 - “is 3 greater than OR equal to 3?” 3==5 - “is 3 equal to 5?” (2*5)==10 “is 2 times 5 equal to 10?” (2*5)!=11 “is 2 times 5 NOT equal to 11?” We can also store things in R’s memory, and we need to name them: TODO assignments TODO environment TODO image - look x is now up there. we can refer to x and it will give us the value! TODO exercise Useful Settings environment clearing TODO ss with console and environment highlighted. notice the console is in the bottom now, and there’s a new window top left. click file &gt; new rmd. Rscripts, Rmarkdown 1.0.0.1 Editor Useful Settings soft wrap source files 1.0.0.2 Files etc. Using R packages Data in R assignment &lt;- vector matrix data.frame tibble accessors [], $ Tasks for today Starting a new .Rmd document Task Open an Rmarkdown document. File &gt; New File &gt; R Markdown.. When the box pops-up, give a title of your choice (“Intro lab”, maybe?) and your name as the author. The file which opens will have some template stuff in it. Delete everything below the first code chunk to start with a fresh document: Task Insert a new code chunk by either using the Insert button in the top right of the document, and clicking R, or typing Ctrl + Alt + i Inside the chunk, type: print(&quot;Hello world! My name is ?&quot;). Run the chunk and see that the output will be printed below. We’re going to use some functions which are in the tidverse package, which we have already installed earlier on. However, to use the package, we need to load it using library(tidyverse). Important: When writing analysis, we want it to be reproducible - we want to be able to give somebody else our code and the data, and ensure that they can get the same results. To do this, we need to show what packages we use. It is good practice to load any packages you use at the top of your code. Task In your first code chunk, type: #I&#39;m going to use these packages in this document: library(tidyverse) and run the chunk. Note that the # in R code makes that line a comment, which basically means that R will ignore the line. Comments are useful for you to remind yourself of what your code is doing. Task Below the code chunk, add a new line with the following: # R code examples When the # is used in a Rmarkdown file, outside of a code-chunk, it makes that line a heading when we finally get to compiling the document. Below, what you see on the left will be compiled to look like those on the right: Task In your Rmarkdown document, give an explanation of what each of the following does in R. Write the explanation, and give an example in a code chunk. + - * / () ^ &lt;- = &lt; &gt; &lt;= &gt;= == != data.frame() c() [] $ You can see an example of the first few below: Solution Hopefully you managed to include examples for all of these, but we have provided a table below describing what each symbol does. Symbol Description Example + Adds two numbers together 2+2 - two plus two - Subtract one number from another 3-1 - three minus one * Multiply two numbers together 3*3 - three times three / Divide one number by another 9/3 - nine divided by three () group operations together (2+2)/4 is different from 2+2/4 ^ to the power of.. 4^2 - four to the power of two, or four squared &lt;- stores an object in R with the left hand side (LHS) as the name, and the RHS as the value x&lt;-10 = stores an object in R with the left hand side (LHS) as the name, and the RHS as the value x = 10 &lt; is less than? 2&lt;3 &gt; is greater than? 2&gt;3 &lt;= is less than or equal to? 2&lt;=3 &gt;= is greater than or equal to? 2&gt;=2 == is equal to? (5+5) == 10 != is not equal to? (2+3) != 4 c() combines values into a vector (a sequence of values) c(1,2,3,4) data.frame() converts whatever is inside the brackets to a dataframe data.frame(values = c(1,2,3,4)) [] used to extract the 1st, 2nd, … \\(i^{th}\\) elements in a set of numbers myvector[3] $ used to extract a named column from a dataframe mydata$age_variable Storing data Task Add a new heading by typing the following: # Vectors and dataframes Remember: We make headings using the # outside of a code chunk. Task In a new code chunk, do the following: store the following numbers as an object in R: 4,7,3,1,8,9,5,2,2,6,9,9,5,20 Try using the function sum(), with the name of your object inside the brackets. Solution Because this is just a set of numbers, we store it as a vector, using c(). We have named it myvec, but you can call yours whatever you like. The sum() function will add all of the numbers together! myvec &lt;- c(4,7,3,1,8,9,5,2,2,6,9,9,5,20) sum(myvec) [1] 90 Task Using the square brackets - [] - pull out the 2nd, 4th and 6th values in the object you just created. Hint: You will need to put inside the square brackets a sequence of numbers. How do we combine numbers in to a sequence in R? using c()! Solution myvec[c(2,4,6)] [1] 7 1 9 Task In a new code-chunk, store the names and birth-years of the Beatle in the appropriate format in R. Name it beatles. John was born in 1940 Paul was born in 1942 George was born in 1943 Ringo was born in 1940 Hint: We’ve got two sets of values here: the names and the birth-years. The easiest way to think of this would be to have a row for each Beatle, and a column for each of name and birth-year. Check dimensions of the object using dim(). How many rows and how many columns are there? Solution TODO - decide dataframe/tibble We want a dataframe/tibble beatles &lt;- data.frame( name = c(&quot;John&quot;,&quot;Paul&quot;,&quot;George&quot;,&quot;Ringo&quot;), birthyear = c(1940,1942,1943,1940) ) beatles &lt;- tibble( name = c(&quot;John&quot;,&quot;Paul&quot;,&quot;George&quot;,&quot;Ringo&quot;), birthyear = c(1940,1942,1943,1940) ) dim(beatles) [1] 4 2 Four rows, and two columns! Reading in external data So far, we’ve been manually inputting our data. However, R can read in data which has been created elsewhere (like in excel, or by some software which is used to present participants with experiments). TODO - link to data we’re going to use next couple of weeks First, click on the following link: link It should open a webpage and show you a dataset. There are two things to note. the values are separated by commas the url (in the top bar of your browser) ends with .csv. This stands for ‘comma separated value’. The tidyverse package which we loaded at the top has a function to read this sort of data: read_csv(). Task Read the data into R. You can do this by giving read_csv() the url. Hint: If you just type: read_csv(&quot;https://uoe-psychology.github.io/uoe_psystats/multivar/data/women_computer_science.csv&quot;) # A tibble: 192 x 3 date field pct_women_majors &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 1966 Computer.science 0.146 2 1967 Computer.science 0.108 3 1968 Computer.science 0.12 4 1969 Computer.science 0.13 5 1970 Computer.science 0.129 6 1971 Computer.science 0.136 7 1972 Computer.science 0.136 8 1973 Computer.science 0.149 9 1974 Computer.science 0.164 10 1975 Computer.science 0.19 # … with 182 more rows It will print out the dataset, but it won’t store it in R for you to do things with. To do that, we want to assign a name to the data: mydata &lt;- read_csv(&quot;https://uoe-psychology.github.io/uoe_psystats/multivar/data/women_computer_science.csv&quot;) Note that it now turns up in the Environment pane of Rstudio. TODO image Task Check how many rows and columns you have in the dataset. You can do this with the dim() function. Solution dim(mydata) [1] 192 3 Task Using the square brackets, show the 167th row, with all columns. Remember: When you are using [] with a dataframe, you specify data[rows, columns]. If you leave either rows or columns blank it will give all of them - for instance, data[ , columns] will give you all rows for some specified columns. Solution mydata[167,] # A tibble: 1 x 3 date field pct_women_majors &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 1988 Physical.Sciences 0.32 Task By now, you should have an Rmardkown document ( .Rmd ) with your answers to the tasks we’ve been through today. Compile the document by clicking on the Knit button at the top. The little arrow to the right allows you to compile to either .pdf or .html. Glossary "],
