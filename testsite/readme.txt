Put any 'live' documents (final/current versions, rather than dev versions) in here.  

github pages builds from /docs, meaning that any .htmls are rendered accordingly, and you can
link directly to these from LEARN etc.  

Try to preserve a sensible directory structure.  
 
calling the cod below from the parent dir will update index.html meaning that you can navigate to https://uoe-psychology.github.io/uoe_psystats/ and see all live documents.
> makeindex.py /docs
