# A. Worked example: NFL Salaries

## A.1. Sampling to Resampling

Think back to last week. We saw a dataset of all the National Football League players at the beginning of 2015, along with their yearly salaries. This was our population.

In real life we often don't have data on the entire population, so let's imagine we only collect one sample of 50 players.  
We can approximate the sampling distribution of $\bar{x}$ (the mean salary of our sample) by bootstrapping. 

1. Collect a sample of 50 players.
2. Compute the mean salary of the sample.
3. Take a random sample with replacement of 50 players from our original sample (this is known as a resample), and compute the mean of the resample. 
4. Re-do point 3 many times. 

**Solution**  

- Question 1: 
```{r message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(moderndive)

nfl_sample <- read_csv("https://edin.ac/2NATDCQ")

nfl_sample
```

- Question 2:
```{r}
nfl_sample %>%
  summarise(avg_salary = mean(YearlySalary))
```

- Question 3:
```{r}
nfl_resample1 <- nfl_sample %>%
  rep_sample_n(size = 50, replace = TRUE)

nfl_resample1

nfl_resample1 %>% 
  summarise(avg_salary = mean(YearlySalary))
```

- Question 4: 
```{r}
nfl_resample2 <- nfl_sample %>%
  rep_sample_n(size = 50, replace = TRUE)

nfl_resample2

nfl_resample2 %>% 
  summarise(avg_salary = mean(YearlySalary))
```


## Getting to the Bootstrap Distribution  

We can speed up this process by getting R to take many resamples for us, in the same way that last week we asked it to take many samples from a population.  

The below line of code takes 2000 sample of size 50, by sampling with replacement from our original sample of size 50. 
```{r}
nfl_2000resamples <- nfl_sample %>% 
  rep_sample_n(size = 50, replace = TRUE, reps = 2000)

nfl_2000resamples
```

We can compute the mean of each of the 2000 *resamples* drawn from the original sample (just like last week when we computed the mean of each of 2000 samples drawn from the population).
```{r}
nfl_resample_means <- nfl_2000resamples %>%
  group_by(replicate) %>%
  summarise(avg_salary = mean(YearlySalary))
```

and we can plot them:

```{r}
ggplot(nfl_resample_means, aes(x = avg_salary)) + 
  geom_histogram(color = "white") + 
  labs(x = "resample mean")
```

## Calculating confidence intervals using a bootstrap standard error  

```{r}
#recall that our original sample mean was 2.11496
original_sample_mean <- nfl_sample %>% 
  summarise(avg = mean(YearlySalary)) %>%
  pull(avg)

original_sample_mean

nfl_resample_means %>%
  summarise(
    est_SE = sd(avg_salary), 
    ci_lower = original_sample_mean - (1.96 * est_SE),
    ci_upper = original_sample_mean + (1.96 * est_SE)
  ) %>% select(ci_lower, ci_upper)
```


## Take-home message

Using just one sample, it is possible to quantify estimation error by taking repeated resamples with replacement from our original sample. 
We can use this to construct ranges of plausible values of the parameter we are estimating.

# B: Lab 

The following code chunk reads in **a sample** of the Hollywood movies data we saw last week. 
```{r, message=FALSE}
hollywood_sample <- read_tsv('https://edin.ac/2N9yHms') %>% # read the data
  select(Movie, Genre, RottenTomatoes) %>% # selects relevant variables
  drop_na %>% # removes all the NAs
  sample_n(size=25) # takes our sample
```

## B.1  
This week, we're interested in the average Rotten Tomatoes rating for all Hollywood movies between 2007 and 2013.   
What is our best estimate of this with the data we just read in?

...

## B.2  
Calculate the sample statistic

```{r}

```

## B.3  
Generate 1000 bootstrap resamples to create the bootstrap distribution. 

```{r}

```

## B.4 
Estimate the standard error of the sample statistic from your bootstrap distribution.

```{r}

```


## B.5  
Compute the 95% confidence intervals around our estimate of the average Rotten Tomatoes rating, and plot the bootstrap distribution and the confidence interval.

```{r}

```

## B.6

Go back to where we read in the data, and change the sample you are collecting from 25 to 50. 
Run the previous tasks again.
How has the confidence interval changed?

## B.7
Look back to last week. What was the population mean yearly salary for all NFL players at the beginning of 2015? 
  
$\mu$ = ??  
  

## B.8
A researcher lives in Boston. They want to estimate salaries of NFL players, and in 2015 they go around and ask 50 players about their yearly salaries.  
The code below reads in the sample they collected.

```{r message=FALSE}
nflboston <- read_csv("https://edin.ac/35QVPwp")
```

Compute the sample mean, and calculate 99% confidence intervals via bootstrap standard error

```{r}



```


## B.9 
This confidence does not include the population mean. Why not?  
*hint:* Look at your data, and think about what you know about how it was collected - why might this not be a good sample?
