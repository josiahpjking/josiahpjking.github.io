# A. Worked examples

We flip the coin 90 times, and it lands on heads 55 times. 

## A.1. Calculate our statistic  
```{r}
p_hat <- 55/90
p_hat
```

## A.2 Generate the null distribution 

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
set.seed(15732)
# Specify our possible outcomes and their probabilities under the null
outcomes <- tibble(vals = factor(c('Heads', 'Tails')))
prob <- c(1/2, 1/2)

# generate samples under the null
samples <- rep_sample_n(outcomes, size = 90, replace = TRUE, reps = 1000, prob = prob)

# calculate the statistics for each sample to create the null distribution
null_distribution <- samples %>% 
  group_by(replicate) %>%
  summarise(prop = sum(vals == 'Heads') / n())
```

and we can now plot our null distribution: 

```{r}
ggplot(null_distribution, aes(x = prop)) +
  geom_dotplot(binwidth = 0.01, dotsize = 0.5, fill = 'white', stackratio = 0.5) +
  labs(x = expr(hat(p)))
```

And plot the observed statistic on top, like we did last week. 

```{r}
ggplot(null_distribution, aes(x = prop, fill = (prop >= 0.61))) +
  geom_dotplot(binwidth = 0.01, dotsize = 0.5, stackratio = 0.5) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c('white', 'tomato1')) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0.61, color = 'tomato1', size = 1) +
  labs(x = expr(hat(p)), fill = expr(hat(p) >= 0.61))
```

## A.3 Calculate our p-value

```{r}
pvalue <- null_distribution %>%
  summarise(
    pvalue_bothtails = sum(prop <= 0.39 | prop>=0.61) / n(),
    pvalue_2righttail = 2 * sum(prop>=0.61) / n()
  )

pvalue
```

## A.4 Formal decision

According to our p-value, we have reason to reject the null hypothesis that our coin will land on heads and tails equally often.

## A.5 A Trick coin

I have a trick coin which is weighted so that it lands on heads 60% of the time (rather than the usual 50% for a normal fair coin). 

In Tom's 50 coin flips, what proportion of heads would lead him to the correct conclusion that the coin is a trick coin?

## A.6 Generate Tom's null distribution 
```{r message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
# Specify the possible outcomes and their probabilities under the null
outcomes <- tibble(vals = factor(c('Heads', 'Tails')))
prob <- c(0.5, 0.5)

# generate samples under the null
samples <- rep_sample_n(outcomes, size = 50, replace = TRUE, reps = 1000, prob = prob)

# calculate the statistics for each sample to create the null distribution
null_distribution <- samples %>% 
  group_by(replicate) %>%
  summarise(prop = sum(vals == 'Heads') / n())
```

## A.7 Find Tom's critical values  

```{r warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
crit_val <- 
  null_distribution %>%
  summarise(crit95 = quantile(prop, 0.95)) %>%
  pull(crit95)

crit_val
```



## A.8 Calculate Tom's Power

We can do this by generating the sampling distribution for when the coin is biased towards heads 60% of the time (which we know is actually true).  
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
outcomes <- tibble(vals = factor(c('Heads', 'Tails')))
prob <- c(0.6, 0.4)

samples <- rep_sample_n(outcomes, size = 50, replace = TRUE, reps = 1000, prob = prob)

# calculate the statistics for each sample to create the true distribution
true_distribution <- samples %>% 
  group_by(replicate) %>%
  summarise(prop = sum(vals == 'Heads') / n())
```

And find out what proportion of this distribution is greater than his critical value!
```{r}
true_distribution %>%
  summarise(
    prob_crit = sum(prop >= crit_val) / n()
  )

```

# B. Lab

Are novice players of Rock, Paper, Scissors biased to choosing scissors less often?

## B.1: Write out your null and alternative hypotheses. Is our alternative hypothesis one-sided or two-sided?


## B.2: 
Assuming that novice players actually choose Scissors only 1/5 of the time ($p = 1/5$), calculate the power to detect this if we conduct a test (at $\alpha = 0.05$) based on 75 games of Rock, Paper, Scissors with novice players. 

We need to generate our null distribution:
```{r}



```

And calculate the critical value (note that because the alternative is $p < 1/3$, we are looking for the bottom 5%, rather the top 5%):

```{r}




```

Construct an alternative distribution:
```{r}






```

And calculate power.
```{r}




```

## B.3: 
Calculate the power if we were to conduct the same test at $\alpha = 0.01$ instead.

We would have a different critical value:
```{r}



```

And our power would therefore change accordingly:
```{r}




```


## B.4: Calculating power for a different coin.

If my trick coin was actually weighted so that it landed on heads 65% of the time, what would the power of Tom's test (50 flips) be? 

We already know the critical value at which Tom will reject the null hypothesis based on his 50 flips. 
We need to:

Generate the theoretical distribution of $\hat(p) = 0.65$. 
```{r}



```

Calculate what proportion of this distribution is greater than his critical value. This will be the power.
```{r}




```


# C. Extra Exercises

## C.5: Sample size (number of flips) and power  

Assuming the coin to be biased towards landing on heads 60% of the time, calculate the power of Tom's statistical test for when he flips the coin 75 times, 100 times, and 200 times. Which sample size should Tom use if he wants at least 80% power?

```{r}





```
