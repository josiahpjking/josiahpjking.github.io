## Now over to you: Income Distribution Example

Let's look at some data on income collected for the UK in 2017 by ONS. Note the mean and the median values and the skew. What can you say about the income distribution in the UK? How representative is the data of the true population?

 You can read more about income calculations in the [ONS report](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/personalandhouseholdfinances/incomeandwealth/bulletins/householddisposableincomeandinequality/financialyearending2017), if curious of course.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("https://www.ons.gov.uk/resource?uri=/peoplepopulationandcommunity/personalandhouseholdfinances/incomeandwealth/bulletins/householddisposableincomeandinequality/financialyearending2017/3471bf9a.png")
```

I decided to collect my own sample of individuals and collected the data for 150 residents aged 18+ in London. I further grouped them into North and South. Use the data to study the variation in income. 

Get the data first. Make sure your working directory is set. Go to **Session** -> **Set Working Directory** ->**Choose Directory** ->**Locate your folder** . Then run the following:

```{r}
# Get the data
income_london <- read.csv('income_london.csv')
```


Work inside this template for this week and attempt the following steps. You will need to add your own R code chunks and write some text. Here are the steps you may want to take:

- Work with the data on income to provide information about the income distribution for Londoners.

- Save an RMarkdown file for this lab, make notes where necessary and replicate the steps you have seen in the worked example.

- Make sure to visualise the data, describe it and write a few notes with conclusions about what you found. Work first with income variable.
- Are there differences based on geography (i.e. North versus South)? Note: you may need to analyse the income by region here.

- Pay attention to the sample size and how representative it can be of the **true population** (i.e. can we use the London mean to represent the UK?)

- Compile your file in the end to produce the final report. Polish off some chunks to make it all look nicer!

- Congratulate yourself on the amazing work you have done over past five weeks! To do this first run `install.packages('praise')`.




Then run the following:
```{r}
library(praise)
praise()
```
