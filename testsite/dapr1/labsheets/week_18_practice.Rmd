# Change in score on the ACE-III

Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination-III (ACE-III) is a brief cognitive test that assesses five cognitive domains: attention, memory, verbal fluency, language and visuospatial abilities. The total score is 100 with higher scores indicating better cognitive functioning.  
A research project is examining changes in cognitive functioning with age, and administers the ACE-III to a set of participants at age 60, then again at age 70.  

## A.1 How is the data from this study paired?


...


## A.2 Write out the null and alternative hypotheses in words, and using the appropriate symbols.  


... 


## A.3 Read in the data, and make a new column of the difference in scores for each pair.   

The data is available as a **.csv** from https://edin.ac/2Tz1cNH. 


...


## A.4 Perform a one-sample $t$-test to see whether the mean difference score is equal to 0.


...

## A.5 The code below produces a visualisation of the scores on the ACE-III at ages 60 and 70. 
 
```{r}
ggplot(data = ace_iii, aes(x = age, y = score)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

1. Based on what we found out when we conducted our $t$-test, sketch what you think the code will produce.  
2. What does the data `ace_iii` need to look like for this to work?  


... 


## A.7 Calculate the effect size for the mean difference in scores on the ACE-III from age 60 to 70.

# Age differences in heterosexual marriages

Is there an age difference in heterosexual married couples? (and in what direction?)  

Data on the ages of both brides and grooms at point of marriage:  
```{r}
marriages<-read_csv("https://edin.ac/2TBoZMY")
```


## B.1 Add new column which is the husband's age minus the wife's age.  

As we plan on conducting a test on these differences, what assumptions are we making about them, and how can we check whether those assumptions hold?  


...

## B.2 Think carefully..
If we are about to conduct a t-test on the difference scores we just calculated, what will the results mean?  If we get a positive t-statistic ($t > 0$), in what direction is the difference? Who will it mean tends to be older than whom?  


...

## B.3 
1. Conduct a one sample $t$-test that the age differences are not equal to 0.  
2. Using the `paired = TRUE` argument of `t.test()`, conduct the same test on the ages themselves (rather than the differences).
3. Check that the results from 1 and 2 match. 


...

## B.4 Calculate Cohen's $D$.


...

## C: Smoking interventions  

A researcher has developed a cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) based smartphone app, and is testing how effective it is in helping people to stop smoking.  
They recruit 60 participants who are trying to quit smoking, and over a week record the average number of cigarettes smoked per day for each participant. 
Thirty participants are given the app, and asked that every time they feel like smoking they open the app on their phone and complete one five-minute task. 
All 60 participants are followed up one month later, and the average number of cigarettes smoked per day (over a week) is recorded.  

1. At point of recruitment, did the 60 participants smoke more or less than 20 cigarettes per day?  
2. Calculate the average number of cigarettes smoked per day at both time-points for each group. 
3. Did the average number of cigarettes smoked per day differ between the groups at the initial recruitment?  
4. Did the group given the app change their smoking habits from the immediate to one month follow up? If so, was it a big change? (e.g, calculate the effect size).    

The data (**.csv**) is available at https://edin.ac/2vRr3r9.
