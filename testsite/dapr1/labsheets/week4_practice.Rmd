Before you start, make sure that you have `tidyverse` loaded.

```{r}
# Load tidyverse
library(tidyverse)
```

## Exercise 1

For your first practice we want you to build a plot based on the example you have seen in the tutorial. We will work with `diamonds` again. 

```{r}
# Get diamonds dataset
data <- diamonds
```

Can you check which variables we have?

```{r}
# Glimpse at your data

```

Select variable **carat** and produce a simple histogram (finish the expression below):

```{r}
# ggplot of carat
ggplot(data = data, aes(x = carat )) 
```

Once you are happy with what you see above, try to add labels and change colours. Your final graphic of carats histogram should look like this (run the expression below) to see which graphic we need - (note: it is alright if your colours are slighly diffrent).

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Run to see the graphic
knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/UoE-Psychology/dapR/blob/master/dapR_1/week_4/plot1.jpeg?raw=true")
```


```{r}
#ggplot histogram for carat (add labels, title, colours)

```

## Exercise 2

Now I am keen to look at the categorical variable **cut** again and ideally, I want to plot the differences in diamond weight by  **cut**.

Let's first produce a plot for **cut**, you need to use `geom_bar` here:

```{r}
# ggplot for cut
ggplot(data = data , aes(x = ))

```

Try to make it a little nicer. Your final graphic of cut should look like this (run the expression below) to see which graphic we need:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Run to see the graphic
knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/UoE-Psychology/dapR/blob/master/dapR_1/week_4/plot2.jpeg?raw=true")
```

```{r}
# ggplot for cut (add labels, title, colours)

```

Finally, get the visualisation of **carat** by **cut**:

```{r}
# ggplot for carat by cut (add labels, title, colours) - I started this one for you:
ggplot(data = data, aes(x = , y = , fill = ))

```










## Exercise 3 - Advanced 

Here is a plot which is based on slighly different data. For this task you will need to get the data and explore it yourself. You will then want to work with key variables that are visible on the plot below. Your task is to recreate four plots below:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Run to see the graphics you need to build (part 1)
knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/UoE-Psychology/dapR/blob/master/dapR_1/week_4/plot3.jpeg?raw=true")

```

```{r}
# Run to see the graphics you need to build (part 2)
knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/UoE-Psychology/dapR/blob/master/dapR_1/week_4/plot4.jpeg?raw=true")
```


```{r}
# Load data
data2 <- iris

```

Explore what iris data has using `help`:

```{r}
?iris
```

```{r}
# Simple plots

```


**Hint:** you may need to install and load `library(ggridges)`

```{r}
# Advanced plots

```
