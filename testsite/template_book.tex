Data analysis for psychology in R 1 or, in short, \textbf{DAPR1}, is your first step on the exciting road of analysing data, and using data to answer interesting questions in the ways that statisticians, researchers, data scientists do.

This year-long course is designed to work gently through conceptual content that form the basis of understanding and working with data to perform statistical testing. It will provide you with the foundations in working with data and probability theory, and build to learning about how we make inferences about our hypotheses in psychology. Concepts are demonstrated in R throughout, taking you from basic calculations to the foundations of data management, plotting and use of simple statistical tests.

The overall aim of the course is to provide you with all the necessary skills to feel confident in the basics of statistics, R and data, before we move on to discuss a broader array of statistical methods in year 2.

\subsection*{First look at Rstudio}\label{first-look-at-rstudio}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{First look at Rstudio}

Okay, now you should have a project open, and you should see something which looks more or less like the below, where there are several little windows.

\includegraphics{images/installing_intro/freshr.png}

We're going to explore what each of these little windows offer by just diving in and starting to do things.

\hypertarget{r-as-a-calculator}{%
\subsection*{R as a calculator}\label{r-as-a-calculator}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{R as a calculator}

Starting in the left-hand window, you'll notice the little blue arrow {\textgreater{}}.
This is where we R code gets \emph{executed}.
Type 2+2, and hit enter ↵

It's a calculator!

Let's work through some of the basic operations (adding, subtracting etc).\\
Try these commands yourself:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{2+5}
\item
  \texttt{10-4}
\item
  \texttt{2*5}
\item
  \texttt{10-(2*5)}
\item
  \texttt{(10-2)*5}
\item
  \texttt{10/2}
\item
  \texttt{3\^{}2} (Hint, interpret the \texttt{\^{}} symbol as ``to the power of'')
\end{itemize}

\textbf{A little note}

Whenever you see the blue arrow ({\textgreater{}}), it means R is ready and waiting for a command.

If you type \texttt{10+} and press enter, you'll see that instead of {\textgreater{}} you are left with {+}. This means that R is waiting for more. Either give it more, or cancel the command by pressing the escape key on your keyboard.

Now let's take a sidestep.\\
As well as performing calculations, we can \emph{ask} R things, such as ``Is 3 less than 5?'':

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\DecValTok{3}\OperatorTok{<}\DecValTok{5}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] TRUE
\end{verbatim}

Try the following:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{3\textgreater{}5} - ``is 3 greater than 5?''
\item
  \texttt{3\textless{}=5} - ``is 3 less than OR equal to 5?''
\item
  \texttt{3\textgreater{}=3} - ``is 3 greater than OR equal to 3?''
\item
  \texttt{3==5} - ``is 3 equal to 5?''
\item
  \texttt{(2*5)==10} ``is 2 times 5 equal to 10?''
\item
  \texttt{(2*5)!=11} ``is 2 times 5 NOT equal to 11?''
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{r-as-a-calculator-with-a-memory}{%
\subsection*{R as a calculator with a memory}\label{r-as-a-calculator-with-a-memory}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{R as a calculator with a memory}

We can also store things in R's memory, and to that we just need to give them a name.\\
Type \texttt{x\ \textless{}-\ 5} and press enter.

What has happened? We've just stored something named \texttt{x} which has the value \texttt{5}.
We can now refer to the name and it will give us the value!
Try typing \texttt{x} and hitting enter. It should give you the number 5.\\
What about \texttt{x*3}?

\textbf{Storing things in R}

The \texttt{\textless{}-} symbol is used to \emph{assign} a value to a named object.

\emph{{[}name{]}} \textless{}- \emph{{[}value{]}}

Note, there are a few rules about names in R:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  No spaces - spaces \emph{inside} a name are not allowed (the spaces around the \texttt{\textless{}-} don't matter):

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \texttt{lucky\_number\ \textless{}-\ 5} ✔   \texttt{lucky\ number\ \textless{}-\ 5} ❌\\
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Names must start with a letter:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \texttt{lucky\_number\ \textless{}-\ 5} ✔   \texttt{1lucky\_number\ \textless{}-\ 5} ❌\\
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Case sensitive:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \texttt{lucky\_number} is different from \texttt{Lucky\_Number}\\
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Reserved words - there is a set of words you can't use as names, including: if, else, for, in, TRUE, FALSE, NULL, NA, NaN, function\\
  (Don't worry about remembering these, R will tell you if you make the mistake of trying to name a variable after one of these).
\end{itemize}

You might have noticed that something else happened when you executed the code \texttt{x\textless{}-5}.
The thing we named \textbf{x} with a value of \textbf{5} suddenly appeared in the top-right window. This is known as the \textbf{environment}, and it shows everything that we store things in R:

\includegraphics{images/installing_intro/rassign.png}

We've now used a couple of the windows - we've been executing R code in the \textbf{console}, and learned about how we can store things in R's memory (the \textbf{environment}) by assigning a name to them:

\includegraphics{images/installing_intro/r4panel2.png}

Notice that in the screenshot above, we have moved the \textbf{console} down to the bottom-left, and introduced a new window above it. This is the one that we're going to talk about next.

\hypertarget{rscripts-and-rmarkdown}{%
\subsection*{Rscripts and Rmarkdown}\label{rscripts-and-rmarkdown}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Rscripts and Rmarkdown}

What if we want to edit our code?\\
Whatever we write in the console just disappears upwards. What if we want to change things we did earlier on?

Well, we can write and edit our code in a separate place \emph{before} sending it to the \textbf{console} to be executed!!

\hypertarget{r-scripts}{%
\subsubsection*{R scripts}\label{r-scripts}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{R scripts}

\textbf{Task}
1. Open an R script
+ \textbf{File \textgreater{} New File \textgreater{} R script}
1. Copy and paste the following into the R script

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{x<-}\DecValTok{210}
\NormalTok{y<-}\DecValTok{15}
\NormalTok{x}\OperatorTok{/}\NormalTok{y}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  With your text-cursor (blinking vertical line) on the top line:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Ctrl + enter (Windows)
  \item
    Cmd + enter (MacOS)
  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

Notice what has happened - it has sent the command \texttt{x\textless{}-210} to the console, where it has been executed, and \textbf{x} is now in your environment.\\
Additionally, it has moved the text-cursor to the next line.\\
\includegraphics{images/installing_intro/reditor.png}

\textbf{Task}
Press Ctrl + enter (Windows) or Cmd + enter (MacOS) again.\\
Do it twice (this will run the next two lines).

Then, change \textbf{x} to some other number in your R script, and run the lines again (starting at the top).

\textbf{Task}
Add the following line to your Rscript and execute it (send it to the console pressing Ctrl/Cmd + Enter):

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{plot}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{,}\DecValTok{5}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

A very basic plot should have appeared in the bottom-right of Rstudio.
The bottom-right window actually does some other useful things.

\textbf{Task}
1. Save the Rscript you have been working with:
+ File \textgreater{} Save
+ give it an appropriate name, and click save.
1. Check that you can now see that file in the project, by clicking on the ``Files'' tab of the bottom-right window.

\hypertarget{rmarkdown}{%
\subsubsection*{Rmarkdown}\label{rmarkdown}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Rmarkdown}

In addition to R scripts, there is another type of document we can create, known as an ``Rmarkdown''.

Rmarkdown documents combine the analytical power of R and the utility of a text-processor.

We can have one document which contains all of our analysis as well as our written text, and can be \emph{compiled} into a nicely formatted report.

This saves us doing analysis in R and copying results across to Microsoft Word. It ensures our report accurately reflects our analysis.

Everything that you're reading now has all been written in Rmarkdown!

We're going to use Rmarkdown documents throughout this course.
We'll get into it how to write them lower down, but Rmarkdown documents are basically written text interspersed with ``code-chunks''. In the example below, you can see the grey boxes indicating the R code, with text in between.\\
We can then compile the document into either a \textbf{.pdf} or a \textbf{.html}.

\includegraphics{images/installing_intro/compiling.png}

\hypertarget{recap}{%
\subsection*{Recap}\label{recap}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Recap}

Okay, so we've now seen all of the different windows in Rstudio in action:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The \textbf{console} is where R code gets executed
\item
  The \textbf{environment} is R's memory, you can \emph{assign} something a name and store it here, and then refer to it by name in your code.
\item
  The \textbf{editor} is where you can write and edit R code and Rmarkdown documents. You can then send this to the console for it to be executed.
\item
  The bottom-right window shows you the \textbf{plots} that you create, the \textbf{files} in your project, and some other things (we'll get to these later).
\end{itemize}

\includegraphics{images/installing_intro/r4panel3.png}

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{0.5pt}\end{center}

\hypertarget{take-a-breather}{%
\section{Take a breather}\label{take-a-breather}}

Below are a couple of our recommended settings for you to change as you begin your journey in R.
After you've changed them, take a 5 minute break before moving on to learning about how we store data in R.

\textbf{Useful Settings 1: Clean environments}

As you use R more, you will store lots of things with different names. Throughout this course alone, you'll probably name hundreds of different things.\\
This could quickly get messy within our project.

We can make it so that we have a clean environment each time you open Rstudio. This will be really handy.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  In the top menu, click\\
  \textbf{Tools \textgreater{} Global Options\ldots{}}
\item
  Then, \emph{untick} the box for ``Restore .RData into workspace at startup'', and change ``Save workspace to .RData on exit'' to ``Never'':
  \includegraphics{images/installing_intro/renvsettings.png}
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Useful Settings 2: Wrapping code}

In the editor, you might end up with a line of code which is really long:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{x <-}\StringTok{ }\DecValTok{1}\OperatorTok{+}\DecValTok{2}\OperatorTok{+}\DecValTok{3}\OperatorTok{+}\DecValTok{6}\OperatorTok{+}\DecValTok{3}\OperatorTok{+}\DecValTok{45}\OperatorTok{+}\DecValTok{8467}\OperatorTok{+}\DecValTok{356}\OperatorTok{+}\DecValTok{8565}\OperatorTok{+}\DecValTok{34}\OperatorTok{+}\DecValTok{34}\OperatorTok{+}\DecValTok{657}\OperatorTok{+}\DecValTok{6756}\OperatorTok{+}\DecValTok{456}\OperatorTok{+}\DecValTok{456}\OperatorTok{+}\DecValTok{54}\OperatorTok{+}\DecValTok{3}\OperatorTok{+}\DecValTok{78}\OperatorTok{+}\DecValTok{3}\OperatorTok{+}\DecValTok{3476}\OperatorTok{+}\DecValTok{8}\OperatorTok{+}\DecValTok{4}\OperatorTok{+}\DecValTok{67}\OperatorTok{+}\DecValTok{456}\OperatorTok{+}\DecValTok{567}\OperatorTok{+}\DecValTok{3}\OperatorTok{+}\DecValTok{34575}\OperatorTok{+}\DecValTok{45}\OperatorTok{+}\DecValTok{2}\OperatorTok{+}\DecValTok{6}\OperatorTok{+}\DecValTok{9}\OperatorTok{+}\DecValTok{5}\OperatorTok{+}\DecValTok{6}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

You can make Rstudio `wrap' the line, so that you can see it all, without having to scroll.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{x <-}\StringTok{ }\DecValTok{1}\OperatorTok{+}\DecValTok{2}\OperatorTok{+}\DecValTok{3}\OperatorTok{+}\DecValTok{6}\OperatorTok{+}\DecValTok{3}\OperatorTok{+}\DecValTok{45}\OperatorTok{+}\DecValTok{8467}\OperatorTok{+}\DecValTok{356}\OperatorTok{+}\DecValTok{8565}\OperatorTok{+}\DecValTok{34}\OperatorTok{+}\DecValTok{34}\OperatorTok{+}\DecValTok{657}\OperatorTok{+}\DecValTok{6756}\OperatorTok{+}\DecValTok{456}\OperatorTok{+}\DecValTok{456}\OperatorTok{+}\DecValTok{54}\OperatorTok{+}\DecValTok{3}\OperatorTok{+}\DecValTok{78}\OperatorTok{+}\DecValTok{3}\OperatorTok{+}\DecValTok{3476}\OperatorTok{+}\DecValTok{8}\OperatorTok{+}\DecValTok{4}\OperatorTok{+}\DecValTok{67}\OperatorTok{+}
\DecValTok{456}\OperatorTok{+}\DecValTok{567}\OperatorTok{+}\DecValTok{3}\OperatorTok{+}\DecValTok{34575}\OperatorTok{+}\DecValTok{45}\OperatorTok{+}\DecValTok{2}\OperatorTok{+}\DecValTok{6}\OperatorTok{+}\DecValTok{9}\OperatorTok{+}\DecValTok{5}\OperatorTok{+}\DecValTok{6}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{enumerate}

\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Installing R packages}

Alongside the basic installation of R and Rstudio, there are many add-on packages which the R community create and maintain.

The thousands of packages are part of what makes R such a powerful and useful tool - there is a package for almost everything you could want to do in R.

In order to be able to write and compile Rmarkdown documents (and do a whole load of other things which we are going to need throughout the course) we are now going to install a set of packages known collectively as the ``tidyverse''.

\textbf{Task}
In the \textbf{console}, type \texttt{install.packages("tidyverse")} and hit enter.

Lots of red text will come up, and it will take a bit of time.

When it has finished, and R is ready for you to use again, you will see the little blue arrow {\textgreater{}}.

\hypertarget{starting-a-new-.rmd-document}{%
\subsection*{Starting a new .Rmd document}\label{starting-a-new-.rmd-document}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Starting a new .Rmd document}

\textbf{Task}
Open a new Rmarkdown document.

\textbf{File \textgreater{} New File \textgreater{} R Markdown..}

When the box pops-up, give a title of your choice (``Intro lab'', maybe?) and your name as the author.

The file which opens will have some template stuff in it. Delete everything below the first code chunk to start with a fresh document:

\includegraphics{images/installing_intro/ss_newrmd.png}

\textbf{Task}
Insert a new code chunk by either using the Insert button in the top right of the document, and clicking R, or typing \emph{Ctrl + Alt + i}

Inside the chunk, type:\\
\texttt{print("Hello\ world!\ My\ name\ is\ ?")}.

To execute the code inside the chunk, you can either:
+ do as you did in the R script - put the text-cursor on the first line, and hit Ctrl/Cmd + Enter to run the lines sequentially
+ click the little green arrow at the top right of your code-chunk to run all of the code inside the chunk.

You can see that the output gets printed below.

\hypertarget{using-r-packages}{%
\subsection*{Using R packages}\label{using-r-packages}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Using R packages}

We're going to use some functions which are in the \textbf{tidyverse} package, which already installed above.\\
However, it's not enough just to install it - to actually \emph{use} the package, we need to load it using \texttt{library(tidyverse)}.

When writing analysis code, we want it to be \textbf{reproducible} - we want to be able to give somebody else our code and the data, and ensure that they can get the same results. To do this, we need to show what packages we use.\\
It is good practice to load any packages you use at the top of your code.

\textbf{Task}
In your first code chunk, type:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{#I'm going to use these packages in this document:}
\KeywordTok{library}\NormalTok{(tidyverse)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

and run the chunk.\\
\emph{Note, you might get various messages popping up below when you run this chunk, that is fine).}\\
:::yellow\\
\textbf{Comments in code}\\
Note that using \texttt{\#} in R code makes that line a comment, which basically means that R will ignore the line. Comments are useful for you to remind yourself of what your code is doing.
:::

\textbf{Task}
\textbf{Below} the code chunk, add a new line with the following:

\# R code examples

Note that when the \# is used in a Rmarkdown file \textbf{outside} of a code-chunk, it will make that line a heading when we finally get to \emph{compiling} the document. Below, what you see on the left will be compiled to look like those on the right:\\
\includegraphics{images/installing_intro/headings.png}

\textbf{Task}
In your Rmarkdown document, choose a few of the symbols below, and write an explanation of what it does, giving an example in a code chunk. You can see an example of the first few below.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item

\subsection*{Storing data in R: Sequences (``Vectors'') of values}\label{storing-data-in-r-sequences-vectors-of-values}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Storing data in R: Sequences (``Vectors'') of values}

We've already seen how to assign a value to a name/symbol using \texttt{\textless{}-}.\\
However, we've only seen how to assign a single number, e.g, \texttt{x\textless{}-5}.

To assign a sequence of values to R, we combine the values using \texttt{c()}.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{myfirstvector <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{,}\DecValTok{5}\NormalTok{,}\DecValTok{3}\NormalTok{,}\DecValTok{7}\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{myfirstvector}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 1 5 3 7
\end{verbatim}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{myfirstvector }\OperatorTok{+}\StringTok{ }\DecValTok{5}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1]  6 10  8 12
\end{verbatim}

Values don't have to be numbers, but note what happens when we try to add 5 to a sequence which includes some non-numbers:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{mysecondvector <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{,}\DecValTok{4}\NormalTok{,}\StringTok{"cat"}\NormalTok{,}\StringTok{"dog"}\NormalTok{,}\StringTok{"parrot"}\NormalTok{,}\StringTok{"peppapig"}\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{mysecondvector }\OperatorTok{+}\StringTok{ }\DecValTok{5}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Error in mysecondvector + 5 : non-numeric argument to binary operator

\hypertarget{reading-in-data}{%
\subsection*{Reading in data}\label{reading-in-data}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Reading in data}

While we can manually input data like we did above, more often, we will need to read in data which has been created elsewhere (like in excel, or by some software which is used to present participants with experiments).

\textbf{Task}
Add a new heading by typing the following:

\# Reading and storing data

\textbf{Remember:} We make headings using the \# \emph{outside} of a code chunk.

\textbf{Task}
Open Microsoft Excel, or LibreOffice Calc, or whatever spreadsheet software you have available to you, and create some data with more than one variable.

It can be whatever you want, but we've used a very small example here for you to follow, so feel free to use it if you like.

We've got two sets of values here: the names and the birth-years of each member of the beatles. The easiest way to think of this would be to have a row for each Beatle, and a column for each of name and birth-year.

\includegraphics{images/installing_intro/create_data.png}

\textbf{Task}
Save the data as a \textbf{.csv} file.

Although R can read data when it's saved in Microsoft/LibreOffice formats, the simplest, and most universal way to save data is as simple text, with the values separated by some character - \textbf{.csv} stands for \textbf{comma separated values}.

In Microsoft Excel, if you go to:
\textbf{File \textgreater{} Save as}\\
In the Save as Type box, choose to save the file as \textbf{CSV (Comma delimited)}.

\textbf{Important:} save your data in the project folder you created at the start of this lab.

Back in Rstudio\ldots{}

Next, we're going to read the data into R. We can do this by using the \texttt{read\_csv()} function, and directing it to the file you just saved.

\textbf{Task}
Create a new code-chunk in your Rmarkdown, and in the chunk, type:
\texttt{read\_csv("name-of-your-data.csv")}, where you replace \emph{name-of-your-data} with whatever you just saved your data as in your spreadsheet software.

\textbf{Helpful tip}

If you have your text-cursor inside the quotation marks, and press the tab key on your keyboard, it will show you the files inside your project. You can then use the arrow keys to choose between them and press enter to add the code:

TODO - screencap gif

When you run the line of code you just wrote, it will print out the data, but will not store it. To do that, we need to assign it as something:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{beatles <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{read_csv}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"data_from_excel.csv"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Note that this will now turn up in the \emph{Environment} pane of Rstudio.

Now that we've got our data in R, we can print it out by simply using its name:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{beatles}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
# A tibble: 4 x 2
  name   birth_year
  <chr>       <dbl>
1 John         1940
2 Paul         1942
3 George       1943
4 Ringo        1940
\end{verbatim}

And we can do things such as ask R how many rows and columns there are:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{dim}\NormalTok{(beatles)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
[1] 4 2
\end{verbatim}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{str}\NormalTok{(beatles)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
Classes 'spec_tbl_df', 'tbl_df', 'tbl' and 'data.frame':    4 obs. of  2 variables:
 $ name      : chr  "John" "Paul" "George" "Ringo"
 $ birth_year: num  1940 1942 1943 1940
 - attr(*, "spec")=
  .. cols(
  ..   name = col_character(),
  ..   birth_year = col_double()
  .. )
\end{verbatim}

\textbf{Task}
Use \texttt{dim()} to confirm how many rows and columns are in your data.

Use \texttt{str()} to take a look at the structure of the data.\\
Don't worry about the output of \texttt{str()} right now, we'll pick up with this in the next lab.

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{0.5pt}\end{center}

\textbf{Task}
By now, you should have an Rmardkown document ( \textbf{.Rmd} ) with your answers to the tasks we've been through today.

Compile the document by clicking on the \textbf{Knit} button at the top. The little arrow to the right allows you to compile to either \textbf{.pdf} or \textbf{.html}.

In a new code chunk, do the following:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  store the following numbers as an object in R:\\
  4,7,3,1,8,9,5,2,2,6,9,9,5,20\\
\item
  Try using the function \texttt{sum()}, with the name of your object inside the brackets.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Solution }
Because this is just a set of numbers, we store it as a \textbf{vector}, using \texttt{c()}.\\
We have named it \texttt{myvec}, but you can call yours whatever you like.

The \texttt{sum()} function will add all of the numbers together!

\end{Highlighting}

\end{verbatim}

\textbf{Task}
Using the square brackets - \texttt{{[}{]}} - pull out the 2nd, 4th and 6th values in the object you just created.

\textbf{Hint:} You will need to put inside the square brackets a \emph{sequence of} numbers. How do we combine numbers in to a sequence in R? using \texttt{c()}!

\textbf{Solution }

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{myvec[}\KeywordTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{2}\NormalTok{,}\DecValTok{4}\NormalTok{,}\DecValTok{6}\NormalTok{)]}

\begin{verbatim}

\end{verbatim}

\textbf{Task}
Using the square brackets, show the 167th row, with all columns.

\textbf{Remember:} When you are using \texttt{{[}{]}} with a dataframe, you specify \texttt{data{[}rows,\ columns{]}}. If you leave either rows or columns blank it will give all of them - for instance, \texttt{data{[}\ ,\ columns{]}} will give you all rows for some specified columns.

thus far - we've talked about summarising a visualising datasets - ``descriptive statistics''.

this is only a small part of statistics, and we will now start to look at a much more powerful tool - how we can make statistical inferences.

would we be surprised to discover true param is different? how different?
