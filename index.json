We observe 120 birds, noting down the time at which each one arrives in the garden, and then how many worms they have caught by the end of the day:\n Centering predictors in standard regression In our model1 $ _0 + _1 + $, linear transformations of our predictor (such as mean-centering/standardising etc) make no difference to the estimated slope. They change the intercept estimate, because they change where “zero” is. One way to think about this is changing where the y-axis cuts the x-axis - we are simply shifting it right/left-wards, and thus moving the intercept estimate (see the plots below, in which the data and regression model are indentical, but the intercept (larger black dot) is shifted according to what zero represents on the x-axis). When you have an interaction, applying a linear transformation to a predictor again makes no difference to our estimate of the interaction term. It will change the intercept and the conditional effect of the interacting variable, again because it changes “what zero means”.\nYou can see this intuition in the visualisation below, in which we have a continuous (arrival_time) \\(\\times\\) categorical (blackbird vs wren) interaction. The difference between blackbirds and wrens (distance between large black and large brown dots) “at zero” on x-axis is different depending on the transformation of x.\n Centering predictors in MLM Suppose that we had birds clustered into different gardens. The average arrival time varies between gardens (if you want some context for the example, imagine that we’re on an island and all the island birds nest in the forest in the center of the island. Some gardens are further away than others, so the average arrival time for birds in these gardens is later than those closer to the forest).\nThere are two different mechanisms going on here, generally known as between and within effects. Gardens to which birds on average arrive later seem to result in a greater yield of worms (maybe the worms are slow to wake up and there are more of them around later in the day?). However, within a given garden it would seem that the later a bird arrives the fewer worms they catch.\nIf we were only interested in the between effects, we might be inclined to fit a linear regression with cluster robust variance estimates. If we are potentially interested in both, then we’ll likely want to use a mixed effects model.\nHowever, we have some options of how to fit our model:\n random effect (re)\nlibrary(lme4) mod_re \u0026lt;- lmer(nworms~arrival_time+(1|gardenid), data=df) Within\nWe can group mean center, which essentially provides our “within” estimate:\ndf \u0026lt;- df %\u0026gt;% group_by(gardenid) %\u0026gt;% mutate( arrival_time_groupcentered = arrival_time - mean(arrival_time) ) mod_within \u0026lt;- lmer(nworms ~ arrival_time_groupcentered + (1|gardenid), data=df) Mundlak We can also specify our between effect, by including the group means.

Bird number 21 arrived at her garden at 5am, but unfortunately caught zero worms:\nIn the Mundlak model, the coefficient estimate for the group mean effect of 4.09 represents the answer to the question:\n in the hypothetical world where Bird 21’s garden has an average arrival time of 4:10am, rather than the observed 3:10am, and Bird 21 continues to wake up at 5, how many more worms will she get?  We can visualise this counterfactual scenario (in blue below), by increasing the mean arrival time for the garden by 1hr. The Mundlak between coefficient is the estimated difference between the actual predicted (red) and the counterfactual predicted (blue), assuming that Bird 21 doesn’t change her arrival time. The within-between model, on the other hand, provides the estimate for the group mean effect of 1.11, which assumes that an increase in the average arrival time for birds in the garden will also entail Bird 21’s arrival time increasing. So if Bird 21 continues to arrive at the same time relative to the other birds in that garden, and they all simply arrive an hour later, this is how many worms she gets. It answers the question:\n In the hypothetical world where Bird 21’s garden has an average arrival time of 4:10am as opposed to the observed 3:10am (thereby Bird 21 would have an arrival time of 6am as opposed to the observed 5am), how many more worms will she get?  blah blah blah.\nI just wanted to makes some plots really.\nFor a (much) better discussion, see: Bell, A., Fairbrother, M. \u0026amp; Jones, K.

Having finally finished it all, I figured that I should make a few quick plots, and take some time to look back on the process.\nDISCLAIMER\nThere’s a point which can’t be made strongly enough about a thesis: quality \u0026gt; quantity. If you’re starting out/in the midst of your PhD, I would encourage you not to get too fixated on the wordcount of your thesis. The number of words you write can be a pretty useless metric of progress. For that purpose, I have omitted any specific numbers of words and timescales from this blogpost, to avoid anyone from drawing comparisons between their own progress and mine. All PhDs are different - don’t compare yourself too much to others.\nBy the end of it, I’m not sure that my thesis had either quality or quantity, and instead I would probably offer up different benchmarks of PhD success: 1) Learning things, and 2) Having fun. Provided you come out of the other end feeling that you’ve done those two things at least occasionally during your PhD, then you’ve probably done okay.\n\nWith that out of the way, let’s push on and see what happens…\nI set up the word counting using crontab to execute a bash script every day which saved the date and output of texcount into a .txt file. This meant I ended up with daily records of the words in each chapter, so I could work out thing such as how many words were added on each day.\nFirst though, let’s just take a look at how the total word count of the thesis grew.\nThe first thing to note (not a huge surprise to me, or anyone) is that writing is fairly slow-going. There are some gaps where I was doing an internship (I had high hopes of being motivated and continuing to work on the thesis during this period, but that just didn’t happen), and a smaller one for Christmas, but other than that it’s fairly steady, and not that steep (although you won’t be able to tell that from the absence of axis labels!). I can retrofit certain memorable feelings that I had, for instance the panic writing which resulted from being offered a job. You can see all this in the figure above. For context, I’ve added some of the key life events for me (that was a pretty big year!), as well as the various jobs I was doing along the bottom.\nI also recorded the wordcounts split up by the chapters which I was working on. At the start I imagined that there I would devote definite periods to different chapters, but in reality the process was quite skittish (see below - what a mess!). I seemed to switch between working on different chapters pretty frequently (46% of the days on which I actually did some writing/editing, I did so in more than one chapter). I think this probably reflects various attempts to avoid dealing with problems by working on something else!\nI can also take a look at which days of the week I worked, and how many words were added/removed on each day. Some of this fits with how it felt when I was writing. I remember noting that I’d spend more time editing and deleting stuff on the Monday, and that Tuesday was a day for adding new content. The figure below shows the addition of content for each day of the week, excluding days that I did not do any work (the vertical dashed line is zero).\nSo what? Take home message: Don’t count your words. You’ll get some nice plots, but they won’t really mean anything. PhD’s can be a long long process, and a thesis will be finished (to quote my mother when asked at what time dinner would be) “whenever it’s ready”.\n ","date":1571184000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1571184000,"objectID":"0c07a1656b2387e225cc1f27c8ca1b64","permalink":"https://josiahpjking.github.io/publication/thesis-metadata/","publishdate":"2019-10-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/thesis-metadata/","section":"publication","summary":" This is a pretty light-hearted first blog post.
