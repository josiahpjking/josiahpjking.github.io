I am currently working as a senior teaching coordinator in statistics in the Department of Psychology at the University of Edinburgh. I coordinate the teaching of undergraduate and postgraduate courses in statistics & quantitative methods using R.

I have previously worked for the Scottish Centre for Administrative Data Research (SCADR), and Scottish Government. I completed my PhD in Psychology at the University of Edinburgh, studying nonverbal behaviour in relation to deception and cognitive load.
